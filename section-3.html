<h2>Career Paths</h2>

<p>Princeton students graduate into a <a class="ext" href="https://careercompass.princeton.edu/career-fields">wide range of career fields</a>, informed by skills learned throughout their studies. This <a class="ext" href="https://tableaupublic.princeton.edu/t/CareerServices/views/UndergraduateAlumniOccupations/Concentration-Occupation?%3Aiid=1&amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&amp;%3Aembed=y">interactive chart</a>, illustrates how – within an academic division (e.g., engineering) or across the University – those paths are not dictated by major.</p>

<p>A great way to start exploring a career option is by reading about someone who followed that path. Check out the Career Compass website, where alumni offer advice and reflections about their experiences.</p>
