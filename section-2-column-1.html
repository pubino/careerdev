<h2>Meeting with a career adviser</h2>

<p>We offer in person and virtual one-on-one advising to help students reflect on their values and strengths, pursue opportunities that match their unique interests and design personalized plans to achieve their goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Advising sessions are casual conversations. Whether you have a topic in mind or if you’re not sure where to start, meeting with an adviser is a good next step.</p>

<p>You do not have to have anything figured out before an advising appointment. Advisers can help you talk through your questions, figure out what interests you and start putting together a personalized plan.</p>

<h3>Common Topics</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Career exploration</li>
	<li>Networking&nbsp;(how to&nbsp;talk with alumni about their careers, how to prepare for a career fair, etc.)</li>
	<li>Internship, job and fellowship search strategies</li>
	<li>Interview preparation</li>
	<li>Resume, cover letter and&nbsp;personal statement reviews</li>
	<li>Planning for graduate school and preparing applications</li>
</ul>

<p>Students of all class years are encouraged to meet with a career adviser. We have a team of advisers who specialize in different career fields and interests.</p>

<p>If you’re a first- or second-year student looking for advice from fellow students, our Peer Career Advisers (PCAs) are a great resource.</p>
